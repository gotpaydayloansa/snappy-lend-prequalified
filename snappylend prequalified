Of all the consumer financial services and products on the market today, it would be safe to say that none attract quite the same stigma and reputation as payday loans. Ever since the industry first got off the ground in its modern form, consumer groups and critics in epic numbers have vied to soil the name of all who offer these loans and warn the public of the danger they pose. Conversely, the payday loans industry has grown by the day and has never been larger or more widespread, with more consumers opting for payday loans than ever before. What's more, there are just as many consumers taking the corner of the payday lender and commending their services are there are critics, which can make it rather difficult to know who to side with.

The question is therefore, if looking to take home a small sum of cash when time is a factor, is there really a way of ensuring the chosen payday lender is safe and reputable?

Thankfully, the simple answer to the question is yes as each and every consumer with an internet connection already has at their disposal all the evaluation tools they could ever need.
